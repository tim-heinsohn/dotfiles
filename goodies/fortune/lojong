Slogan 1.

First, train in the preliminaries; The four reminders or alternatively
called the Four Thoughts.

    A. Maintain an awareness of the preciousness of human life.
    B. Be aware of the reality that life ends; death comes for everyone;
       Impermanence.
    C. Recall that whatever you do, whether virtuous or not, has a result;
       Karma.
    D. Contemplate that as long as you are too focused on self-importance and
       too caught up in thinking about how you are good or bad, you will
       experience suffering. Obsessing about getting what you want and avoiding
       what you don't want does not result in happiness; Ego.

# dotfiles

Debian Stretch w/ vim flavor.

Symlinks are created with `./bin/symlink-dotfiles.sh`.

Installers are in `setup/`.

## Notes

*(2019-06-26)* references to README files etc. from now on preferably point to
the _raw_ version (e. g. on Github), so in Vim the can be looked up directly
via `gf`.

# Spawn gemini for help on understanding how tools actually work

If you need to analyze a tool such as Kamal or AnythingLLM, you can checkout
their repository into /srv/lib/[repo] and request `gemini` to analyze it, place
insights into GEMINI.md (in that repository) and try to answer the open
question (and place that in a dedicated doc/[topic].md). The answer shall be
given back directly or placed in a specific file that you tell `gemini`.

# Coding Standards

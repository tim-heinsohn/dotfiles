Follow these steps precisely to interact with the Playwright MCP:

## @playwright/mcp@latest

1.  **Start the server in the background.** It is critical that you add an `&`
    at the end of the command to prevent the agent from hanging. For example:
    `your-playwright-mcp-start-command &`
    â€“ please also capture the PID to allow terminating the server at the end.
2.  **Wait for the server to be ready.** You might need a short `sleep` command
    here, e.g., `sleep 5`.
3.  **Send commands to the server.** For example, to open a page:
    `your-playwright-mcp-client-command open "https://example.com"`
4.  **Fetch the content.** `your-playwright-mcp-client-command fetch`
5.  **Crucially, close the server.** You must send the `kill <PID>`, where
    <PID> is the process ID of the server, to terminate the server process.

## @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server

1.  **Start the server in the background.** It is critical that you add an `&`
    at the end of the command to prevent the agent from hanging. For example:
    `npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server &`
2.  **Wait for the server to be ready.** You might need a short `sleep` command
    here, e.g., `sleep 5`.
3.  **Send commands to the server.** 
4.  **Fetch the content.**
5.  **Crucially, close the server.** You must send the `playwright_close` tool
    command to terminate the server process.

Example:

```bash
(echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"playwright_navigate","arguments":{"url":"https://www.google.com"}},"id":1}'; echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"playwright_close","arguments":{}},"id":2}') | npx @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

Let's learn from this session and keep some notes.
So please revise the current session for issues, insights, instructions,
conventions, preferences and found solutions that may be worth memorizing.

Create a list of suggestions: list potential additions to the existing
CLAUDE.md files and docs, covering the following four sections:

1. **Tools** - did you use any tools, got issues and found specific ways to use those tools? Or just used tools useful but nowhere mentioned?
2. **Specialized Agents** – were parts of the session an interesting use case for an expert sub agent that yet could be defined?
3. **Slash Commands** – any instructions with potential for frequent usage, worh a refined Claude slash command?
2. **Rules & Conventions** – general preferences, assumptions, conventions, approaches, "always/never" statements worth noting for later reference?
